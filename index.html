<h1 id="videos">ABOUT THE SCHOOL</h1>
<p>DPS Newtown, under the aegis of the DPS society is a state-of-the-art modern school, the only DPS situated in the heart of Newtown. Spread over a sprawling 12-acre plush campus, the school is equipped with the best of amenities, giving the students ample opportunities to manifest their talents.

    Since its inception on 25th April 2005, the school has striven to provide a holistic education experience that ensures high standards of academic excellence complemented by a kaleidoscope of co-curricular activities. The focus is on nurturing well-rounded personalities with the skills to excel in the world they will inherit in time.
    
    Likewise every child has a nascent talent that waits to be nurtured into a colourful reality. But nothing about their innocent dreams gives away their true potential and their hidden ambition.
    
    We at DPS Newtown help parents recognize, inspire and give wings to this specific gift of their child. We allow every child to explore, discover and experience his/her own world. We allow them to make their dream a reality and help them metamorphose into a bright individual. We have amidst us the most experienced of teachers and academicians who help us in this endeavour.</p>
